# pyXattr

- The GUI should provide a list of files matching the regular expression or wildcards that the user puts in the search box [x] 


TO DO
- visualize only the file name (possible via  list_folders(PDFfolders:list,ascending=False,DEBUG=True,fullpath=False))
    - need to keep the path to pass it to `pyXattr`
- visualize the filename on multiple rows as necessary


DONE

- complies with `cannot use geometry manager grid inside .!frame which already has slaves managed by pack` as required with newer Tkinter (>=8.6)
